=head1 NAME

Module::Build::Pluggable::PDL - Plugin to Module::Build to build PDL projets

=head1 VERSION

version 0.20

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Build.PL
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Module::Build::Pluggable ('PDL');

    my $builder = Module::Build::Pluggable->new(
        dist_name  => 'PDL::My::Module',
        license    => 'perl',
        requires   => { },
    );
    $builder->create_build_script();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a plugin for L<Module::Build> (using L<Module::Build::Pluggable>)
that will assist in building L<PDL> distributions. Please see the
L<Module::Build::Authoring> documentation if you are not familiar with it.

=item Add Prerequisites

    requires => { 'PDL' => '2.000' },
    build_requires => {
        'PDL'                => '2.000',
        'ExtUtils::CBuilder' => '0.23',
    },

You can, or course, require your own versions of these modules by adding them
to C<requires => {}> as usual. 

=item Process C<.pd> files

The C<lib> directory of your distribution will be searched for C<.pd> files
and, immediately prior to the build phase, these will be processed by
C<PDL::PP> into C<.xs> and C<.pm>. files as required to continue the build
process.  These will then be processed by C<Ext::CBuilder> as normal. These
files are also added to the list of file to be cleaned up.

In addition, an entry will be made into C<provides> for the C<.pm> file of the
C<META.json/yml> files. This will assist PAUSE, search.cpan.org and metacpan.org
in properly indexing the distribution and 

=item Generate C<.pod> file from the C<.pd>

When building the distribution (C<./Build dist> or C<./Build distdir>), any
C<.pd> file found in the C<lib> directory will converted into C<.pod> files.
This produces a standalone version of the documentation which can be viewed
on search.cpan.org, metacpan.org, etc. When these sites attempt to display 
the pod in the C<.pd> files directly, there is often formatting and processing
issues.

This is accomplished by first processing the files with C<PDL::PP> and then
C<perldoc -u>.

=item Add Include Dirs

    include_dirs => PDL::Core::Dev::whereami_any() . '/Core';

The C<PDL/Core> directory is added to the C<include_dirs> flag.

=item Add Extra Linker Flags

    extra_linker_flags =>  $PDL::Config{MALLOCDBG}->{libs}
      if $PDL::Config{MALLOCDBG}->{libs};

If needed, the MALLOCDBG libs will be added to the C<extra_linker_flags>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This is essentially a rewrite of David Mertens' L<Module::Build::PDL> to use
L<Module::Build::Pluggable>. The conversion to L<Module::Build::Pluggable>
fixes multiple inheritance issues with subclassing L<Module::Build>. In
particular, I needed to be able use the L<Module::Build::Pluggable::Fortran>
in my PDL projects.

Thank you David++ for L<Module::Build::PDL>.

Of course, all of this just tweaks the L<Module::Build> setup.
